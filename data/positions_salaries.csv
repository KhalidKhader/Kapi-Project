Chief Investment Officer (CIO),"We are a leading Property Development Group in the UK that is on the verge of disrupting the Over 55’s property market sector.
Why does it need disrupting?
Gone are the days of waiting to get old and move into a care home that is provided for by the government. Sadly, governments today have fiscally bankrupted themselves and have no means or desire to provide for the very ones who contributed immensely to the civilisations they inhabit.
We intend to do something about this that not only answers the immense need (1.5+m retirement homes needed today in the UK, 11.1m people over 55 in the UK as of today) but moreover, do it in such a way that minimises their tax liabilities.
To assist us in executing this vision, we are needing a competent, dynamic, and resourceful Chief Investment Officer (CIO).
We envisage this individual to currently be employed within the investments market, this could stem from promoting stocks, bonds, alternate assets, equities, capital, finance, real estate, lawyers, accountants…
The key dynamic is this individual possessing a significant number of active investors that they have personally done business with before, this is crucial.
And as we live in the most deceitful time in history where everyone proclaims to be anyone they choose to be, without being able to back up their words with works or deeds.
It is mandatory that this individual performs a “Live Test”or “Proof of Performance” test. See, the proof is always in the pudding, the pudding representing the works and if you make the pudding, then the role is yours.

Moreover, anyone with an existing network of HNW investors or equity partners should easily be able to secure these funds within 30/45days maximum.
Can you do this?
If so, we will guarantee you upfront that you will be given this position, so no further requirements needed by you to obtain this position, nothing...

· Help a market sector that is in desperate need of help
All the above is only after you complete the “Live Test” so, this is crystal clear, we will provide you with nothing apart from more details on the project described above, with this information you must go directly to your HNW network and raise the GBP £5.5m within 30/45 days maximum.

Chief Investment Officer (CIO),"We are a leading Property Development Group in the UK that is on the verge of disrupting the Over 55’s property market sector.
Why does it need disrupting?
Gone are the days of waiting to get old and move into a care home that is provided for by the government. Sadly, governments today have fiscally bankrupted themselves and have no means or desire to provide for the very ones who contributed immensely to the civilisations they inhabit.
We intend to do something about this that not only answers the immense need (1.5+m retirement homes needed today in the UK, 11.1m people over 55 in the UK as of today) but moreover, do it in such a way that minimises their tax liabilities.
To assist us in executing this vision, we are needing a competent, dynamic, and resourceful Chief Investment Officer (CIO).
We envisage this individual to currently be employed within the investments market, this could stem from promoting stocks, bonds, alternate assets, equities, capital, finance, real estate, lawyers, accountants…
The key dynamic is this individual possessing a significant number of active investors that they have personally done business with before, this is crucial.
And as we live in the most deceitful time in historywhere everyone proclaims to be anyone they choose to be, without being able to back up their words with works or deeds.
It is mandatory that this individual performs a “Live Test”or “Proof of Performance” test. See, the proof is always in the pudding, the pudding representing the works and if you make the pudding, then the role is yours.
